the command I used was:
strings data.txt | grep -e '=' 
where 
strings: The strings command is used to extract printable strings from files. It scans a given file and prints sequences of characters that are likely to be human-readable text.
data.txt: The filename data.txt represents the file from which we want to extract strings and search for lines containing '='.
|: The pipe symbol is used to redirect the output of the strings command as input to the grep command.
grep: The grep command is used for searching text patterns within files or input streams.
-e '=': The -e option in grep is used to specify the pattern to search for. In this case, the pattern is the character '='
