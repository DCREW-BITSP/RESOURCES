Create a temporary directory under /tmp to work with. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123.

Copy the "data.txt" file to the temporary directory: cp data.txt /tmp/myname123/.

Navigate to the temporary directory: cd /tmp/myname123.

Determine the appropriate file extension for the compressed file. Use the file command to get information about the file type: file data.txt.

The output will provide insights into the compression format, such as gzip or bzip2.
Rename the "data.txt" file to its original compressed file name. Replace <filename> with the appropriate name.

Example: mv data.txt <filename>
If the file is compressed with gzip, use the gzip -d command to decompress it: gzip -d <filename>.

Repeat this step as necessary if there are multiple compression layers.
If the file is compressed with bzip2, use the bzip2 -d command to decompress it: bzip2 -d <filename>.

Repeat this step as necessary if there are multiple compression layers.
Continue decompressing the file until you reach the uncompressed file.

Once you have the uncompressed file, use the cat command to view its contents: cat <filename>.
