use this command:
openssl s_client -host localhost -port 30001
where:
openssl: This is the command to invoke the OpenSSL toolkit, which provides a wide range of cryptographic functions, including secure network connections.

s_client: This is a subcommand of OpenSSL that acts as an SSL/TLS client. It allows you to establish an encrypted connection to a server.

-host localhost: This option specifies the host to connect to. In this case, it is set to localhost, which refers to the local machine itself.

-port 30001: This option specifies the port number to connect to. 

By running this command, you are instructing OpenSSL to establish an SSL/TLS connection to the specified host (localhost) on the specified port (30001). 
This is typically done to communicate securely with a server that requires encryption, such as when submitting passwords or sensitive information.

Once the connection is established, you can interact with the server through the terminal.
