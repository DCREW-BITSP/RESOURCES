cd into the inhere directory
I used find command to get the answer, though the first time I did this level I think I did it using ls too.
anyways, the command I used this time was:
find . -type f -readable ! -executable -size 1033c
where
The find command is used to search for files and directories.
The dot (.) represents the current directory, so the search will be performed in the current directory and its subdirectories.
-type f specifies that only regular files should be considered.
-readable ensures that the file is human-readable.
! -executable excludes executable files from the search.
-size 1033c specifies the size of the file should be 1033 bytes.
