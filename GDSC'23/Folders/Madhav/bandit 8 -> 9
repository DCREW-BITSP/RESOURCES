the command I used was:
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -c -u
where
cat: The cat command is used to concatenate and display the contents of a file. In this case, it is used to read the contents of the file data.txt.
data.txt: The filename data.txt represents the file from which we want to process the data.
|: The pipe symbol is used to redirect the output of the cat command as input to the sort command.
sort: The sort command is used to sort lines of text in alphabetical order.
|: Another pipe symbol is used to redirect the output of the sort command as input to the uniq command.
uniq: The uniq command is used to filter adjacent duplicate lines of text and display unique lines.
-c: The -c option in uniq is used to count the number of occurrences of each unique line.
-u: The -u option in uniq is used to display only the lines that occur exactly once.
