use the telnet command to connect to the localhost on the specified port. Replace <port> with the actual port number mentioned in the "README" file.

Example: telnet localhost <port>
After connecting, you should see a blank terminal waiting for input.

Type the password for the current level and press Enter.

Note: You won't see the password being typed or any visual feedback.
Wait for a few moments for the server to process the request.

If the password is correct, you should receive a response containing the password for the next level.
