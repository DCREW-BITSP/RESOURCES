you just learnt to make shell scripts in the last level. you need to make another one for this level.
you need to brute force 10000 combinations of password and a unkown pin which is somwehere between 0001 and 9999.
easy!
just make a shell script which looks like this:
#!/bin/bash
for pin in {0001..9999}
	do
		echo "VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar" $pin
done

make it executable using
chmod +x <script.sh>

now pipe the output of this script to <output.txt> using
./<script.sh> | cat > output.txt

now connect to port 30002 and pipe the contents of <output.txt>
cat output.txt | nc localhost 30002 

you'll get the password for the next level.
