I used this command for getting the answer:
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -readable -size 33c 2>/dev/null
where:
find: This command is used to search for files and directories recursively.
/: Specifies the starting directory for the search. In this case, it's the root directory.
-type f: Filters the search to include only regular files.
-user bandit7: Matches files owned by the user "bandit7".
-group bandit6: Matches files that belong to the group "bandit6".
-readable: Filters the search to include only files that are readable by the current user.
-size 33c: Matches files with a size of 33 bytes.
2>/dev/null: Redirects the error output (2) to the null device (/dev/null), effectively discarding any error messages such as "Permission denied."
