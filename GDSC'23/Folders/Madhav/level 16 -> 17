first use:
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
The command nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost is used to perform a port scan on the localhost (your own machine) for a range of ports. 
Let's break down the command and its components:

nmap: This is the command to invoke Nmap (Network Mapper), a powerful network scanning and exploration tool.

-p 31000-32000: This option specifies the range of ports to scan. In this case, it scans ports from 31000 to 32000.
This range includes all ports between these numbers.

localhost: This argument specifies the target to scan. In this case, it is set to localhost, referring to the local machine itself.

By running this command, you are instructing Nmap to scan the range of ports from 31000 to 32000 on the localhost.
Nmap will send probe requests to each port within the specified range to determine if they are open, closed, or filtered.

Nmap will then provide a report that lists the status of each scanned port. 
Open ports may indicate services or applications running on those ports, which can be potential points of interaction or vulnerabilities.

then check all ports using 
openssl s_client -host localhost -port <port>

you will get a RSA private key if you submit the current password to the correct port.
make a directory in /tmp/ using 
mkdir /tmp/<dir_name>/

then make a file and start writing into it using
cat > /tmp/<dir_name>/<file_name>
paste the RSA private key

change the permissions using
chmod 600 /tmp/<dir_name>/<file_name>

then log in to the next level using
ssh -i /tmp/<dir_name>/<file_name> bandit17@localhost -p 2220
