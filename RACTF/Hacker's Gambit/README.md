## Hacker's Gambit

Problem:

DOCTF{c8,f8,h8,g8,d8,a8,b8,e8}

Hint: Only Blacks and first letter of each count


Looking at a chess board, we can figure out the flag is the starting letter of each piece on the board
- c8, f8 - Bishop (B)
- b8, g8 - Knight (K)
- a8, h8 - Rook (R)
- d8 - Queen (Q)
- e8 - King (K)

**Flag: DOCTF{BBRKQRKK}**
