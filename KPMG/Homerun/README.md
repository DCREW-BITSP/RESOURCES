Homerun.pdf has the following text hidden as whitetext on white background:

"<\S/D8ju</;(uK8;)!2L:3oAr;D;oR9P['R;H7O"=$q$d=):c$:IB%U9/&%W:IB1\9/'+.:,$05:MY/0;JJZf;,h'n8OZc;;atCU"

Baseball involves bases so we can guess the flag is encoded using some base encryption. Copy the text into cyberchef and try each of the popular bases to get the decoding as Base85->Base64->Base45->Base32

Flag: KPMG{sc0r1ng_a_h0m3run}
